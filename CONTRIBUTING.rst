## Issues

If you've found a bug, let us know about it.

## Pull Requests

For all cases, you should have your own fork of the repo.

To submit a pull request for a **new feature**:

1. Run the tests.  Every pull request for a new feature should have an accompanying unit test and docs changes.  See the `README.md` in the `tests/` and `docs/` directories for details.
2. Create a new branch off of the `master` branch for your feature.  This is particularly helpful when you want to submit multiple pull requests.
3. Add a test (or multiple tests) for your feature.  Again, see `tests/README.md`.
4. Add your new feature, making the test pass.
5. Push to your fork and submit the pull request!
